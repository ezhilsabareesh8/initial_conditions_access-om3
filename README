Tools to produce conservative temperature and salinity from World Ocean Atlas 2023 data, and regrid them to the ACCESS-OM3 model grids.

	1. Run inte.csh to create temperature and salinity files, using monthly data instead of 
           seasonal dta in the upper 1500m. Results are put in /g/data/ik11/inputs/access-om3/woa23/monthly

	2. Run make_inital_conditions.sh in the directory initial_conditions_WOA/ for regridding.
           Results are put in /g/data/ik11/inputs/access-om3/woa23/[01]*

	3. If you're happy with the results, run finalise.sh to git commit and add commit info to the .nc metadata

	4. If you have permissions you can run copy_to_input_rc.sh to copy January initial conditions to /g/data/ik11/inputs/access-om3/input_rc
